Old versions was merged to single files for background and front js by merge.bat script. It's not allowed in some extension stores, so I replaced this behave. Old bat files for merge scripts placed in "old" folder.

Use manifest.v[2-3].json from main "extension" folder as main manifest.json file for extension.

Manifest v3 support currently in testing mode.
